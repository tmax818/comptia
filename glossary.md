32-bit versus 64-bit 
: Processing modes referring to the size of each instruction processed by the CPU. 
: 32-bit CPUs replaced earlier 16-bit CPUs and were used through the 1990s to the present day, though most PC and laptop CPUs now work in 64-bit mode. 
: The main 64-bit platform is called AMD64 or EM64T (by Intel). Software can be compiled as 32-bit or 64-bit. 
64-bit CPUs can run most 32-bit software, but a 32-bit CPU cannot execute 64-bit software.

3-D Printer
: Hardware device capable of small-scale manufacturing. Most 3-D printers use either a variety of filament (typically plastic) or resin media with different properties.

802.11 standards 
: Specifications developed by IEEE for wireless networking over microwave radio transmission in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz frequency bands. The Wi-Fi standards brand has six main iterations: 
    -  a, 
    -  b, 
    -  g, 
    -  Wi-Fi 4 (n), 
    -  Wi-Fi 5 (ac), and 
    -  Wi-Fi 6 (ax). 
: These specify different modulation techniques, supported distances, and data rates, plus special features, such as channel bonding, MIMO, and MU-MIMO.

802.3 Ethernet
: Standards developed as the IEEE 802.3 series describing media types, access methods, data rates, and distance limitations at OSI layers 1 and 2 using xBASE-y designations.

multiple input multiple output (MIMO) 
: Use of multiple reception and transmission antennas to boost wireless bandwidth via spatial multiplexing and to boost range and signal reliability via spatial diversity.</p>
