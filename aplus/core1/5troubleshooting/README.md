# 5.0 Hardware and Network Troubleshooting

## 5.1 Given a scenario, apply the best practice methodology to resolve problems.

- Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes
    1. Identify the problem
       - Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before making changes
       - Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
    2. Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
       - If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
    3. Test the theory to determine the cause
       - Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
       - If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate
    4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
       - Refer to the vendorâ€™s instructions for guidance
    5. Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
    6. Document the findings, actions, and outcomes
