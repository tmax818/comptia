## Installing Motherboards and Connectors

## LESSON INTRODUCTION

One of the main roles for a CompTIA A+ technician is to install and configure personal computer (PC) hardware. This hands-on part of the job is what draws many people to a career in information technology (IT) support. As an IT professional, you will set up desktop computers and help end users to select a system configuration and peripheral devices that are appropriate to their work. You will often have to connect peripheral devices using the correct cables and connectors and install plug-in adapter cards.

To complete these tasks, you must understand how the peripheral devices and internal PC components are connected via the motherboard. As you may encounter many different environments in your work, you must also be able to distinguish and support both modern and legacy connection interfaces.

## Lesson Objectives 

In this lesson, you will:

- Explain cable types and connectors.
- Install and configure motherboards.
- Explain legacy cable types.


# Topic 1A

## Explain Cable Types and Connectors

>CORE 1 EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED
3.1 Explain basic cable types and their connectors, features, and purposes.

A PC is made up of many different components. All these components need to be able to communicate with each other so that the computer can function properly. If you can distinguish connection interfaces and connectors quickly, you will be able to support users by installing, upgrading, and replacing PC peripherals efficiently.

# Personal Computers
 
 The components of a personal computer (PC) are divided between those that are designed to be handled by the user—peripheral devices—and those that would be damaged or dangerous if exposed. Peripheral devices typically perform the function of input (keyboard, mouse, microphone, and camera), output (monitor and speakers), or external storage.
 
The system case/chassis houses the internal components. These include the motherboard, central processing unit ([CPU]), system memory modules, adapter cards, fixed disks, and power supply unit. Most cases use a tower form factor that is designed to be oriented vertically and can be placed on a desk or on the floor.
 
PCs can also be purchased as all-in-one units. All-in-one means that the internal components are contained within a case that is also a monitor.

To perform PC maintenance, you must understand how to open a desktop computer's case.

- A tower case has a side cover that can be removed by sliding the panel from its housing. Cases might be secured by screws or retaining clips and might have anti-tamper security mechanisms. Always refer to the system documentation, and follow the recommended steps.
- The front panel provides access to the removable media drives, a power on/off switch, and light- emitting diodes (LEDs) to indicate drive operation. The front cover can be removed but may require the side panel to be removed first to access the screws or clips that secure it.

 The rear panel provides access to the power supply unit (PSU) sockets. The PSU has an integral fan exhaust. Care should be taken that it is not obstructed, as this will adversely affect cooling. There may be an additional case fan.

Below the PSU, there is a cutout aligned with the motherboard's input/output (I/O) ports. These allow for the connection of peripheral devices.

At the bottom of the rear panel there are cutout slots aligned with the position of adapter card slots to allow cables to be connected to any I/O ports on the cards. These slots should either be covered by an adapter card or a metal strip known as a blanking plate. Uncovered slots can disrupt the proper flow of air around components in the PC and cause overheating and increase the amount of dust in the system.
